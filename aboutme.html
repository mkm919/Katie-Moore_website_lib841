<h1> About Me </h1>
<p> My name is Katie Moore and I am in school at Eastern Kentucky University to be a <I> Library Media Specialist</I>.  I love to read, travel and hang out with friends and family.  I enjoy reading all kinds of books but I generally enjoy reading fantasy and romance.  Some of my favorite authors are <em> Colleen Hoover </em> and <em>Sarah J. Maas</em>.  I like to travel on mission trips and for fun.  Some of my favorite vacations combine two things I enjoy: <br>
1. <strong> History </strong> - I am trying to visit every state, as well as all the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/presidential-libraries" </a> Presidential Libraries </a> <br>
2. <strong> Wine </strong>- I keep track of the wines I taste on an app in my phone <br> <br>
I mostly go on these vacations with my mom.  I have been to 9 Presidential Libraries and have 4 left.  Former President Obama and Trump have not opened yet.  We enjoy learning about history together and both enjoy learning and trying new wines.
