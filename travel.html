<h1> Travel Trips and Tips </h1>
<p> I enjoy traveling and try to do it any chance I get.  My most recent two trips were to St. Charles, Missouri and Dahlonega, Georgia.  St. Charles is an historical town where Lewis and Clark started their journey out west.  It is just outside of St. Louis and is a great location to explore some of the <a href="https://missouriwine.org/education/enjoy-wine/missouri-wine-trails" </a> Missouri Wine Trail </a>.  We went to the first and second vineyards to open in Missouri prior to the prohibition.  It was a fun to taste different wines but also tour the wineries and see the historical buildings used pre-prohibition.

<p> We went to Jimmy Carter's presidential library in Atlanta, Georgia before heading to Dahlonega.  Dahlonega is set in the Blue Ridge Mountains and has several good wineries and hikes.  We stayed in a Airbnb that overlooked the gorgeous mountains where the sunsets were incredible!  The wine was a little pricey but all of the places had incredible backdrops and great, friendly service.

<h3> Tips for Traveling </h3>
<ol>
	<li> If you are traveling internationally, I recommend putting a small bag inside your carry on.  This way you can put your larger carry on above but put all the necessary items in the smaller bag under your feet. 
	<li> Must have items on an international flight: </li>
	<ul>
		<li>foot hammock - this hooks onto the tray table in front of you and allows you to prop your feet up higher to relieve pressure on your thighs 
			<li>neck pillow 
				<li>eye mask and ear plugs 
					<li>extra blanket - flights tend to get chilly 
						<li>compression socks </li>
	</ul>
	<li>If you are traveling by car, I recommend always taking your own pillow in a colorful pillow case so you do not leave it behind. 
	<li>When booking a place to stay, always looks at all the reviews and proximity to the activities you are interested in. 
	<li>I always like to pack jolly ranchers and gum to help when water isn't available right away.
	</li> </ol>
