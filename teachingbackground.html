				<td style="width:70%"> I just finished up my <b> 14th year </b> of teaching at <b>Stephens Elementary </b>.  I have taught 3 years in fifth grade and the rest in fourth grade.  I went into teaching because I felt called to do so and couldn't imagine doing anything else.  Last year I won "Teacher of the Year" at my school and a student I had in fourth grade won "Student of the Year".  It was the first year this was awarded in our school.  I have hundreds of books in my classroom library and have cataloged them using <a href="https://www.booksource.com/" </a> <b> Book Source </b> </a>so I can check books in and out for students.  I love to foster the love of reading in my students so I try to have a large variety of books available for them to try.  This love of reading and technology spurred me into getting a Library Media Specialist degree. </td>
